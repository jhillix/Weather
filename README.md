# Yahoo! Weather RSS Feed

## Intro
Yahoo! Weather RSS Feed for the CLI (Command Line Interface). 100% based off of the same project in the book [Maven: The Definitive Guide](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596517335.do). I did this mainly for practice.

## Build
To build this application:

`mvn install`

## Usage
`java -jar weather-1.X-jar-with-dependencies.jar <zipcode>`
